# Placeholder Images

This directory contains a simple HTML file that can generate placeholder images for the game assets.

The generated placeholder images are simple representations of what the final AI-generated assets should look like.

## Usage
1. Open the `generate_placeholders.html` file in a web browser
2. Click the "Generate Images" button
3. Save the automatically downloaded images to the appropriate directories:
   - Background images to `/backgrounds/`
   - Platform images to `/platforms/`

## Important Note
These placeholder images are temporary and should be replaced with actual AI-generated images based on the text descriptions provided in each asset's respective directory.

The final AI-generated images should match the style and aesthetic of the game while being more visually appealing than these simple placeholders.
